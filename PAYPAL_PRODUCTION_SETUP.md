# üöÄ PayPal Production Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ PayPal Integration Complete

The website now uses real PayPal integration instead of simulated payments. Here's what has been implemented:

### üîß Technical Changes Made

1. **Real PayPal SDK Integration**
   - Replaced simulated PayPal button with real `PayPalButtons` component
   - Uses `@paypal/react-paypal-js` library
   - Implements proper order creation and capture flow

2. **Production-Ready Configuration**
   - Updated PayPal provider for production mode
   - Added proper error handling and logging
   - Configured for USD currency and capture intent

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Updated environment example with production instructions
   - Clear guidance for obtaining Live Client ID

## üîë PayPal Production Setup Steps

### Step 1: Get Your Live PayPal Client ID

1. **Go to PayPal Developer Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://developer.paypal.com/
   - Sign in with your PayPal Business account

2. **Navigate to Apps & Credentials**
   - Click on "My Apps & Credentials" in the dashboard
   - **IMPORTANT**: Switch to "Live" environment (not Sandbox)

3. **Create or Select Your App**
   - If you don't have a Live app, create one
   - Copy the "Client ID" (not Secret)

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

1. **Create `.env.local` file** (if not exists)
2. **Add your Live Client ID**:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_live_client_id_here
   ```

### Step 3: Test the Integration

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test with small amounts**:
   - Try ordering 3 tracksuits ($30 total)
   - Use PayPal's test mode first if available
   - Verify payment flow works correctly

3. **Check payment processing**:
   - Verify orders appear in your PayPal dashboard
   - Check that email notifications are sent
   - Confirm order data is stored in Firestore

## üîí Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ Production Security
- **Live Client ID**: Uses production PayPal credentials
- **HTTPS Required**: PayPal requires HTTPS in production
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for failed payments
- **Logging**: Console logging for debugging

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **Never commit** your Live Client ID to version control
- **Test thoroughly** with small amounts before going live
- **Monitor transactions** in your PayPal dashboard
- **Keep credentials secure** and rotate if compromised

### Payment Flow Testing
- [ ] Order creation works
